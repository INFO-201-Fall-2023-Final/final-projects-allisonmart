                      rates across the United States, focusing on the years 2010, 2014, and 2018. The analysis seeks to uncover patterns 
                      and trends within individual states, shedding light on how pursuing higher education may impact local labor markets. 
                      The significance lies in understanding the intricate relationship between educational attainment and workforce outcomes, 
                      which has implications for economic development, policy formulation, and the well-being of individuals and communities.</p>
                    <p>Our dataset comprises detailed information for each state, encompassing total enrollment in higher education institutions, 
                      total unemployment and employment estimates with corresponding percentages, and the distribution of the workforce across 
                      various industries. By examining these variables over the specified years, the project aims to identify associations 
                      between higher education participation and employment outcomes at the state level. This analysis is of particular interest 
                      due to the potential insights it can offer into the effectiveness of higher education in addressing unemployment challenges, 
                      informing state-level policies, and promoting economic resilience. Ultimately, the findings may contribute to a deeper 
                      understanding of the role of education in shaping local labor markets and facilitate evidence-based decision-making in 
                      education and workforce development.</p>
